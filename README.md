# StaticWebsite

This is a Static Website which was created during the intense Training at AWAcademy during week 6

I created this website to get better knowledge how to create a static responsive website with Bootstrap and CSS editing.

This Project was created after 6 weeks of intensive training to become a junior-java-developer at the Java Fall 2018 Program of [AWAcademy](https://www.awacademy.de) by [Academic Work](https://www.academicwork.de).

The result can be viewed https://cyclist82.gitlab.io/htmlwebsitetest/
